=head1 Description

I<oneko> changes your mouse cursor into a mouse and creates a little cute cat
which starts chasing your mouse cursor.  If the cat catches up the cursor,
it starts sleeping.

=head2 Options

=over

=item B<-help>

Prints help message on usage.

=item B<-tora>

Make cat into "tora-neko".  "Tora-neko" means cat with tiger-like stripe.
I don't know how to say it in English.

=item B<-dog>

Runs a dog instead of a cat.

=item B<-bsd>, B<-bsd_daemon>

Runs a 4.3BSD daemon instead of a cat.

=item B<-sakura>

Runs Sakura Kinomoto instead of a cat.

=item B<-tomoyo>

Runs Tomoyo Daidouji instead of a cat.

=item B<-time> I<interval>

Sets interval timer which determine intervals for cat animation.
Default value is 125000 and unit is micro-second.  Smaller value makes cat
run faster.

=item B<-speed> I<distance>

Specify the distance where the cat jumps at one move in dot resolution.
The default is 16.

=item B<-idle> I<speed>

Specify the speed threshold to wake cat up when mouse is running away.

=item B<-name> I<name>

Specify the window name of the cat.

=item B<-towindow>

When I<oneko> starts with this option, you must select a window by the cursor.
Then cat appears and starts chasing the window instead of a mouse.  You can
select another running I<oneko> as the target window.  If root window is
selected, cat chases mouse as usually.  When the target window is not in sight
and not closed, cat chases mouse as usually.  If the target window is closed,
this program exits.

=item B<-toname> I<name>

Specify the window name of the target to make cat chase it instead of a mouse.
You can specify another running I<oneko> as the target window.  When the target
window is not in sight and not closed, cat chases mouse as usually.  If the
target window is closed, this program exits.

=item B<-tofocus>

Makes cat run to and on top of focus window.  When focus window is not in sight,
cat chases mouse as usually.

=item B<-position> I<geometry>

Specify X and Y offsets in pixels to adjust the position of cat relative to a
mouse pointer.

=item B<-rv>

Reverse background color and foreground color.

=item B<-noshape>

Don't use SHAPE extension.

=item B<-fg> I<color>

Foreground color.

=item B<-bg> I<color>

Background color.

=back

=head2 Resources

The application name is "neko" (or "tora") and the class name is "Oneko".

=over

=item B<tora>

Set C<True> if you want "tora-neko".

=item B<time>

Sets interval timer in micro-second.

=item B<speed>

Sets distance to jump in pixels.

=item B<idle>

Sets speed threshold to wake cat up when mouse is running away.

=item B<noshape>

Set C<True> if you don't want to use SHAPE extension.

=item B<reverse>

Set C<True> if you want to switch foreground and background color.

=item B<foreground>

Foreground color.

=item B<background>

Background color.

=back

=head1 Notes

While this program uses C<XGetDefault>, be sure to use "neko.resource" form. If
you run this program as "tora", by hard or soft link, the B<-tora> option is
enabled by default.
